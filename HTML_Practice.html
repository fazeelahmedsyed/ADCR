        <h3>Learning Paragraphs</h3>
        <h4>What to say?</h4><p> There are certain things that can be said, others cannot be. A major reason for such a distinction is the cultural norm existant within the language being used</p>
        <p>However you say it, it doesnt matter. If it is allowed by society it is welcome. If not, then you are a perpetrator who has brought shame to the language.</p>
