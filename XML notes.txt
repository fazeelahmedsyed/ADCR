A few points on XML:

1. An XML document must have a root element.

2. All elements must have a start tag and be closed, except for the declaration, which is
not part of the actual XML document.

3. XML elements must be properly nested.

4. XML attribute values must be quoted.

5. Tags are named with characters and numbers, but may not start with a number or
“xml.”

6. Tag names may not contain spaces and are case sensitive.

7. Space characters are preserved.

8. Some characters are illegal and have to be replaced by meta characters.

9. Comments can be included as follows: <!-- comment -->.

10. Content can be excluded from parsing using: <![CDATA[...]]>.

11. There are schema defining languages within a XML, such as Document Type Definitions (DTD)
, XML Schema (XSD), etc. These languages are used to define the control syntax of an XML doc.

12. When utilizing multiple XML extensions we may come accross elements with same tag names.
In such a scenario we use namespaces. Namespaces make every tag unique. Example below:

<root xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
xmlns:t="http://funnybooknames.com/crockford">
	<h:head>
		<h:title>Basic HTML Sample Page</h:title>
	</h:head>
	<t:book id="1">
		<t:author>Douglas Crockford</t:author>
		<t:title>JavaScript: The Good Parts</t:title>
	</t:book>
</root>
